About the Project
=================

Goals
-----
- The GUI must be fast and responsive
- The GUI must never get in the way of the user or make them feel claustrophobic
- View precise information about the displayed data (data points)
- Fast, smooth data updating
- Work on multiple platforms and multiple languages
    + Nutmeg core should even run on mobile OSes (Android and iOS)
    + Nutmeg clients should run on desktop (Mac, Linux, Windows)

Non-Goals
---------
- Replace Matplotlib, GNU Plot, Matlab's plotting
- Output to PDF, etc (*for now*... with enough popularity, this will probably change)
